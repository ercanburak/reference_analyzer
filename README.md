# Reference Analyzer
Python code to find all references to a paper from your main folder. Code searches all pdfs to check if the given paper is cited. If cited, it extracts the related part from the paper and saves it to .txt file with the paper name.

It is not a perfect code but does the job for a large literature review ;)
